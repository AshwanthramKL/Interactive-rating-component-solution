### Useful resources

- [Css animations](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp) - This helped me for learning animations. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Media_queries) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand media queries. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
